Third Part: Keyword Extraction and Creation of a Custom List
In this third part of the project, a new feature will be added that allows the application to connect again with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to extract the keywords associated with the found movies and create a custom list based on these keywords. This section will give students the opportunity to practice advanced skills related to Strings, iterators, loops, and regular expressions for text manipulation and analysis. Additionally, this integration will deepen the use of external APIs to enrich the application with real-time data, enhancing the quality and personalization of the user experience.

Objectives of the Third Part
Practice with Strings, Arrays, and Iterators: Use the extracted keywords from movies to work with textual data, creating lists and analyzing the keywords obtained from the TMDb API. Manipulating these lists will help students understand how to work with dynamic data and process unstructured information effectively.
Use of Regular Expressions: Apply regular expressions to identify patterns in texts, filter relevant words, and remove special characters. This exercise will enhance understanding of how regular expressions can be used for textual data manipulation, providing a powerful tool for data analysis and cleaning.
Creation of a Custom List: Build a custom list with the keywords obtained from the API, which will serve as a basis for future analysis and content recommendations. This objective focuses on personalization and the continuous improvement of the user experience through the management of key data.
Requirements for this Part
Connect to the TMDb API again to obtain the keywords of a specific movie selected by the user. This will enrich the database with categorized information that can be used to improve search and personalization. The correct implementation of this feature will contribute to a better understanding of integrating external data into web applications.
Use Strings, iterators, loops, and regular expressions to analyze and process the keywords for each movie and create a custom list with the most relevant keywords. Effective textual data processing is a fundamental skill for any web developer, especially when working with APIs and large volumes of information.
Add a new view to the application that allows users to view the keywords for each movie and provide the option to add specific keywords to their custom list. This feature aims to offer a more interactive and user-oriented experience, improving the application's usability.
Configuration for Obtaining Keywords
To obtain keywords from a movie using the TMDb API, a request must be made to the appropriate endpoint of the API. The process to perform this integration is described below:

Summary of the Third Part
This third part of the exercise will provide students with the opportunity to work with textual data, apply regular expressions, and develop advanced text manipulation skills. Students will learn to analyze and process information obtained from an API and create a custom list that enhances the user experience. Additionally, they will gain a deeper understanding of how keywords and metadata can improve search and personalization in an application. By the end of this part of the exercise, students will have created an application that can extract, analyze, and personalize keywords associated with movies, thereby improving user interaction and personalization capabilities. This will result in a richer user experience tailored to individual interests, allowing users to interact more meaningfully with the available content.
